									  React - 13
Testing-Even you make small change in our application it will introduced bugs anywhere in the app. We should concern about every line of code.So testing is very important.
1. Mannual Testing - Testing what i have developed.
2. There are three type of testing that we do as a developer by writing a code.	
a) Unit Testing
b) Integration Testing
c) End to End Testing 

a) Unit Testing : You Test your React component in isolation.Testing a small portion of our react component not concern about whole app while testing.
b) Integration Testing : Testing the integration of component.
c) End to End Testing : Testing React application as soon as user lands on the website and to user leave the website.We test every type of flow.

For e2e testing we need some tools to do the test but now as a developer we majorily concern about this two testing i.e Unit and Integration Testing. 
Some company demands testing too.

Some of important library for doing testing i.e :
React Testing Library : Builds on Top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React Components.
If we initialised our work using create-react-app the react testing library is pre-installed in it.

React uses something known as "JEST".
It is JS testing framework and react testing library and DOM testing library uses JEST behind the scene.
We both need react testing library and JEST both in our project.

npm i -D @testing-library/react 
npm i -D  jest

Usign Babel :
We are using JEST along with babel so we need to install some additional other dependencies along with it.

Go on the JEST Website and you got all this stuff to install : 
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env

Go and paste the default code to configure it in the babel.config.js

Now as we know that Parcel already used Babel which has its own configuration setting and now when we trying to add extra Parcel configuration.So Parcel will get confused as there is confliction between them.So we have to change Parcel behaviour to accomodate to use Parcel along with the JEST.

(Configuring Parcel Config file to disable default babel transpilation)
So in final we want the new config to work rather than Parcel by default have it.
To do this Parcel says we have to make change in .parcelrc file.
Just go to Parcel documentation for this.

So now we setup our things to work.

How to run testcases ? 
Command : npm run test

Start writing our Test cases :

npx jest --init 
Once we run this command it will ask me some questions like :
1. Choosing the environment that we will used for testing.

JS-DOM
So when we run test cases so there is no server running or browser running.So they need environment to run. They will need a environment oor runtime.
So JSDOM is a libraru which parses and interacts with assembled HTML just like a browser.
So its not actually a browser but it is like a browser which will give you the features of browser.

So when we testing a Header component then it is load there in JS-DOM.

2. Do you want to coverage reports?
It shows the coverage that how much we covered.

3. Which provider should be used to instrument code for coverage?
Select Babel

And we got what it have.

Now install jsdom library.
So if we go and see React testing library and go to setup option.
There we see that if we use React testing library with jest28.
There it is mentioned that if you were using jest 28 or later then jest-environment jsdom package has to be installed seperately.

Earlier when we use React testing library, then at that time this  jest-environment jsdom package already present in the library.

npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom

* __test__ 

*Headers.test.js 
 Headers.test.ts
 Headers.spec.js
 Headers.spect.ts

__ is  called dunder test. 

Sampele :

How to write test cases ?

test ("", ()=>{})
This is how we write test case and it has two arguments. 

sum.js
const sum=(a,b)=>{
    return a+b;
}

export default sum;

sum.test.js
import sum from "../sum";

test("Sum function should calculate the sum of two numbers",()=>{

    const result = sum(3,4);

    //Assertion
    expect(result).toBe(5);
})

npm run test 

* Now running and writing Test cases for React Components.

 
Unit Testing in our Project: 
We are testing of one component independent of the whole app.
Whenever we are testing a UI component in a react, you will have to render that component in js-dom first.(import {render} from "@testing-library/react";)



import {render,screen} from "@testing-library/react";

 npm i @babel/preset-react(To enable jsx to work in test cases in react)

Also do some modification in babel.config.js file 
module.exports = {
    presets: [
    ...... ,
      ["@babel/preset-react",{runtime:"automatic"}],
    .......
    ],
  };

This babel preset react will help testing library to convet jsx code into html so that it could read properly.

toBeInTheDocument() is coming from the library @testing-library/jest-dom 

test("Should load 2 input boxes on Contact component",()=>{

    render(<Contact/>);

    //Role for input box is text-box not input.

    //Querying 
    const inputBoxes = screen.getAllByRole('textbox');
    console.log(inputBoxes);
    //It will give the two virtual dom react element.When you have input
    //component , it is basically jsx.Jsx behind the scene at the end of day is react-element.
    //And react element at the end of day is object. 
    
    expect(inputBoxes.length).toBe(2);

 // or   expect(inputBoxes.length).not.toBe(4); It is like reverse.

})

When we do console.log here it will return jsx element i.e jsx i.e object i.e react-fiber node.

Steps : 
1. Render
2. Querying
3. Assertion 
then test by npm run test

We also group the small test-cases by writing something like "describe".
Descibe block has multiple test-blocks in it.

"it" is an just another name of "test".


Our JS-Dom understand jsx code,react and js code but it not understands redux code,it doesnot know selector... because this is part of redux.
So we have to provide store to our Header where we do the test.
This Provider come from our react-redux.

It also not understand Link component so we have to also give context of the Link component.So for this we have to provide router.

import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import appStore from "../../utils/appStore";
import Header from "../Header";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
it("Should load Header Component with a login button", () => {
  render(
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Provider store={appStore}>
        <Header />
      </Provider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
});


 

We can also pass regex here when we pass text.

//Firing Eventt


    //Querying 
    const loginButton = screen.getByRole("button",{name:"Login"});
  
    //After firing click event it changed it into Logout Buttin.
    fireEvent.click(loginButton);

    const logoutButton = screen.getByRole("button",{name:"Logout"});

    //Assertion
    expect(logoutButton).toBeInTheDocument();



// Integration Testing : How to test conjuction of many components.
 Search.test.js

it("Should render the body component with Search",()=>{

    //render
    render(<Body/>);

    

})

//Mocking the Function : 

fetch is superpower of browser.Its not in core of JS.This is given by the browser. 
The Body is render inside a js-dom which is browser-like things not the browser.So it cant 
understand fetch.
So we have to write mock fetch function.
 global.fetch(global is global object wherever this Body being rendered) 

So we have to replace our global.fetch = jest.fn(()=>{})
This will give me a mock fetch function. This function takes a callback function and here i mock exactly like fetch function works.  

As our fetch function returns promise so we have also return promise for this because i have to make similiar identical to the original fetch function. And it resolve with json 
and this json is again a function that returns a promise.resolve.
  
The test mock funtion is not make actual network call because this test case doesnot run on browser or something which has capability to talk to the world.This only runs on JS-DOM which is a browser like environment.So when we running on there we not actually make a Api call and this test cases work even we disconnect from internet,we dont need internet or browser to run this test cases.
So writing this test cases thats why we writing mock function and thats why we use mock data.

global.fetch = jest.fn(()=>{
  
  return Promise.resolve({
	json : ()=>{
	 return Promise.resolve(MOCK_DATA);
	},
});	

});

{ 
To auto test the testcases after any changes : 
We write like this -
"watch-test": "jest --watch"

And after "npm run watch-test" we used this.
}

One important thing that whenever we doing any async or state change operation then we have to wrap render function into a act funtion.
This act funtion comes from react-dom/test-utils.

it("Should render the body component with Search", async ()=>{

  
	 await act(async ()=>{
        	//render
    	   render(<Body/>);
	}) 
	    

	const searchBtn = screen.getByRole("button",{name:"Search"});
	
	const searchInput = screen.getByTestId(searchInput)
 	//For this give extra attribute i.e like data-testid

	fireEvent.change(searchInput,{target:{value : "burger"}})
	//This object is simulating what we got in the event in the onChange in the jsx 	input tag.

	fireEvent.click(searchbtn);

	const cards = screen.getAllByTestId("resCard");
	
	//assertion 
	expect(cards.length).toBeInTheDocument(5);

})

For Link we have to wrap our component in BrowserRouter.
To used toBeInTheDocument() in document we have to import my "@testinglibrary/jest-dom"
