React Planning the app first for better creation.(Good developer approach)
NamFood :
1.First make plan about How it should look like ?
2.What components we have in our app ?
--> Header - Logo, Nav-items
--> Body = Search,Restro-container
--> Footer - Copyaddress Links Address Contact
External CSS
Inline CSS - It is given using JS object.
style = { { Js object } } or const cssProperties = {} (It is object.) , style = {cssProperties}

And By Slowing making this small component we heading toward making a big app :)
Static --> Dynamic Website (lit)
props short form of properties which something pass to component.
At the end they are just normal argument to the function.
Passing props to component : React wrap all this in a object and pass it to the component as props.
That props is now object.
When we dynamically want to passing some data to the component then we pass it as a props.

--> Data comes from the api or backend in form of JSON.
Config Driven UI - Controlling UI using data,config and it comes from the backend.
UI Layer and Data Layer
Array.join() method
Reusable Component using Dynamic data
Best practicing to write a code.
Array method - map (It is used multiple times like bread and butter.)
Unique Key Property Each child in a list have unique 'key' prop.
React dont recommend indexes for keys if the order of item may change.
Unique id is the best practise.But index as a key is last option but you should keys in the lists.
