● What is Emmet?
● Emmet is a web development tool that helps developers write HTML and CSS code more quickly and efficiently.
Emmet uses abbreviations and shortcuts to generate HTML and CSS code snippets. 
It allows developers to write code faster by expanding these abbreviations into full-fledged HTML or CSS structures. 
For example, you can type a short abbreviation and then use Emmet to automatically generate a complete HTML element with attributes.
div>ul>li*3 
-------->
<div>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</div>


● Difference between a Library and Framework?
● While both libraries and frameworks provide reusable code, a library is a collection of functions that developers call when needed, allowing them to retain control.
In contrast, a framework is a more comprehensive structure that dictates the overall architecture and control flow of an application, with the developer providing specific implementations within that structure.
